mw_debug is the microwatt debugger.

It can talk to the simulator using a socket.

On an Arty board it uses the FTDI device via liburjtag.

## Building on Fedora

```
dnf install urjtag-devel
make
```

If you commonly use it against one target, create an alias as follows:
```
alias mw="$HOME/microwatt/scripts/mw_debug/mw_debug -b jtag"
$ mw gpr 0 10
Connected to libftdi driver.

## Building on Debian

Debian disables the library in the urjtag package. Instead, build against
local urjtag:

```
sudo apt install libftdi-dev
git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/urjtag/git urjtag
cd urjtag/urjtag
./autogen.sh
make
```

And then uncomment the following line in Makefile to build against that copy

```
CFLAGS +=  -I urjtag/urjtag/include/ -L urjtag/urjtag/src/.libs/
```

To run:
```
alias mw="LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/microwatt/scripts/mw_debug/urjtag/urjtag/src/.libs/ $HOME/microwatt/scripts/mw_debug/mw_debug -b jtag"
$ mw
